Assignment #7

Version: 1.0
Due: 2 AM, Fri, November 8, on eLearning

Instructions: This is a required programming assignment (individual or group). 
You can (re)use any code from the text book, and its authors's web sites.


In this project, you will compare the performance of the following sorting
algorithms: (a) Merge sort, (b) Quick sort, (c) Heap sort, and any other
comparison-based sorting algorithm of your choice.

Run each algorithm 1000 times (say) in a loop as follows and calculate
the average running time for an array of size n:
1. Initialize array A[0..n-1] with A[i] = i, for 0 <= i < n.
2. Shuffle the elements to create a random instance:
   for i = n-1 downto 1 do
       j = random integer with 0 <= j <= i
       exchange a[j] and a[i]
3. Sort the array with the selected algorithm.
4. Verify that the sorting is correct:
   for i = 1 to n-1 do
       check if A[i-1] <= A[i]

Repeat the experiment for several n:
	10000, 50000, 100000, 200000, 400000, 800000.
Submit a table of these running times and plot a graph of the
running times (y-axis) of the algorithms vs problem size (x-axis).

Upload your code and your report (pdf or docx) on elearning.
